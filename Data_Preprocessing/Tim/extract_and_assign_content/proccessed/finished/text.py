The Wikimedia Foundation servers are currently experiencing technical difficulties.
The problem is most likely temporary and will hopefully be fixed soon.
Please check back in a few minutes.
For further information, you can visit the #wikipedia channel on the Freenode IRC network.
In the meantime, you may be able to view Google's cached version of this page.
Wikipedia is now one of the most visited sites on the Internet by traffic and
continues to grow, and as a result the Wikimedia Foundation has a constant need
to purchase new hardware. If you would like to help, please donate.

Peter and Karin Dambier

[outages] Sacramento fiber cut?

O1 seems to be affected?  We started getting reports of legacy dial-up 
customers served via O1 managed modems having no service for about the 
last hour. I just talked to a contact with XO and they've confirmed a fiber cut 
in Roseville.  No ETR as of yet, crews are en-route.


[outages] Philly area Broadwing / Focal / Level3 ?

I cannot even call their toll-free help lines, as the figer cut apparently
is affecting that as well, according to their local NOC people, who cannot
chd any more light on this.
I suprisingly just found that I can connect to my colo servers there if I
first ssh to a server I have in germany.  However, traceroutes from here
(comcast) stop as below:
If anybody can shed any light, please cc a reply to james at ns2.pil.net
Thanks,
James Smallacombe
